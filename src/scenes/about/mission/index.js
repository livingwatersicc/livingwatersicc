        The Lord says in Jeremiah 2: 13, My people have committed two sins: They
        have forsaken me, the spring of living water, and have dug their own
        cisterns, broken cisterns that cannot hold water. The Word of God cannot
        be understood by mere intellectual capability (own cisterns, broken
        cisterns that cannot hold water) but by the revelation of the Holy
        Spirit (the spring of living water) to the humble (Matt 11:25).

      <p>Jesus said to the Samaritan woman at the well,</p>
      <Word verse={"John 4: 10"}>
        If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you
        would have asked him and he would have given you living water.
      </Word>
      <p>Furthermore he said,</p>
      <Word verse={"John 4:13"}>
        Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water
        welling up to eternal life .
      </Word>

        It is God’s sovereign will that His children walk in the fullness of the
        freedom granted through Christ. Yet, numerous believers continue to live
        in bondage to entrenched sinful & selfish behaviors and the traditions
        of men. This spiritual captivity often stems from a shallow and
        inattentive engagement with Scripture, which hinders the transformative
        work of the Holy Spirit through the revealed Word.

        The mission of the Living Waters Church is to inspire the believers to
        deeply study God’s Word, inviting the Holy Spirit’s transformative work
        through a growing relationship with God.

        As we earnestly devote ourselves to the diligent study of God's Word,
        the truth it imparts will progressively sanctify and liberate us (John
        8:32), bringing freedom to every area of our lives in accordance with
        His divine purpose.
