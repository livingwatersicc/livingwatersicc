        Jesus said “For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with
        them.”
      </Word>

        In 2016, a small group of believers (Dunedin Prayer Warriors) came
        together fortnightly to pray and seek the Lord, by the initiative of a
        humble believer Bro Rumesh. By the grace of God, this is now (April
        2025) a public church,{" "}
        <em>a planting of the Lord, for the display of His splendor</em> [Isa
        61:3, NIV].
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past nine years, God's mighty hand was over this prayer
        fellowship where all faithful people were drawn closer to Him; there was
        a hunger and thirst for God. There were times of failures, struggles,
        persecutions, trials and testing - but in all of these the power and
        presence of God was tangible.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this time, The fellowship grew stronger in the Word of God
        through His Holy Spirit, and God's love was poured out into the hearts
        of the members. There were regular family retreats connecting with wider
        communities. These retreats played a significant role in the spiritual
        growth of the believers.
