        Welcome to the Living Waters community! We are glad you are here and we

        We are a non-denominational, Bible believing christian community who
        seek to follow <strong>Christ</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless of language, tribe, race, or nationality, we gather together
        as one family to worship the one true Triune <strong>God</strong>. As
        Scripture reminds us in{" "}
        <mark
          title={`9 After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no one could number, of all nations, tribes, peoples, and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, with palm branches in their hands, 10 and crying out with a loud voice, saying, “Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!”`}>
          Revelation 7:9-10
        </mark>
        , people from every nation, tribe, and tongue will stand before His
        throne, united in worship. Here, we celebrate the unity we have in{" "}
        <strong>Christ!</strong>

        The church is run by a set of believing volunteers who are in various
