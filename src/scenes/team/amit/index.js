        Amit was born and raised in India in a Christian family, where he was
        deeply influenced by the testimonies of missionaries who regularly
        visited his church. Their stories inspired him and strengthened his
        belief in the faithfulness of God—who is the same yesterday, today, and
        forever.

        In 2012, Amit traveled to the United Kingdom to attend a Discipleship
        Training School (DTS) with Youth With A Mission (YWAM). During this
        time, he encountered God in a deeply personal way, learning to hear His
        voice and rely on Him daily. This transformative season led Amit to join
        YWAM more fully, where he became involved with Marine Reach, a medical
        ministry focused on bringing practical help and the hope of the Gospel
        to Eastern Europe. Witnessing God's work in the lives of people across
        different cultures affirmed Amit’s calling to live out YWAM’s mission:
        “To know God and to make Him known.”

        In 2015, Amit relocated to Dunedin, New Zealand, where he quickly
        connected with a vibrant community of believers who shared his passion
        for discipleship and missions.
